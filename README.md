# Financial Calculator

## Project Description
* This basic financial calculator gives the user the option to see returns on an investment over a chosen time period
* Or it calculates the house payment over a chosen time period.

This was created as part of my Software Engineering Bootcamp.

## Installation
You can download this program to your local machine and run it in your chosen IDE as long as it has a Python package installed.

## Usage
You can use this small program to calculate returns on an investment or calculate your monthly house payment.

**To calculate investment returns**

It will ask you to type 'investment' into the terminal.
